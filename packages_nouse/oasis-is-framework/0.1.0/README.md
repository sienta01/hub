# OASIS-IS a ChatGPT (or other chatbot) prompting mega framework, by [Rifter](https://github.com/Ryfter) #

This creates a form that lets you fill out the OASIS-IS framework, helping you to get better results from using ChatGPT, Claude, and other chat interfaces.

## Usage ##

There are two formats to using this framework.

1. **:oasis** - ChatGPT ONLY: This is meant to be used in the URL of your browser, or elsewhere, and copied to your URL.  This creates a full URL string that opens up ChatGPT and inserts your prompt. This one also lets you choose the ChatGPT Model used as part of the URL.
2. **:poasis** - This is for use in a prompt input box. It doesn't create a URL but adds the pieces of the OASIS-IS megaprompt to get you started for a conversation.  This works for any chatbot. The model is not passed automatically to this one, you choose the model manually depending on what chatbot you are using.

Not all fields need filled out.  Really, only the objective needs to be filled out.  I would recommend at least filling out the setting and archetype as well.  Filling out all fields will make it a better prompt overall.  The Interpretation / Framework has a list of output frameworks I have been working on for a while.  These work well if you have a specific need.  I've been working on this list for over a year.

## What is OASIS-IS? ##

OASIS-IS, is the acronym to help remember the fields needed for this framework.  
**O**bjective : What do you want to accomplish?
**A**rchetype : Persona, identity, character, or profile.  This can be generic like a manager with 20 years workplace mediation experience, or specific like Batman, Mark Twain, or Jack Sparrow.
**S**etting : Context or background information
**I**llustrations : These are your examples.
**S**tyle : The tone, mood, or voice.  Examples: comedic, formal, casual, business casual.
**I**nterpretation : Output Framework or Structure.
**S**pecification : This is the output style, format, or how the output should look like.  Examples: Table, List, Paragraph, Code Block, etc.

There are two important steps after you create your initial prompt.
**E**valuate : How was the response? Give feedback to your chatbot.
**B**anter : OASIS-IS, is meant to start a conversation.
A really good follow-up prompt is the following:
*That is not specific enough.  Please make one more attempt, and re-research this from scratch.  Please go to all new sources and re-do the above analysis.  However you can still keep the previous research in mind, but make sure to make a second pass at your research and seek out more detailed, comprehensive analytical sources.*
