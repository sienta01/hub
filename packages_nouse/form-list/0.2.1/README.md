# Form list
## A package for getting a list of expansions from one form via a CSV list.

# Setup
The `package.yml` does not need to be edited.

You will need to edit the entries in the `form_urls.csv`. The sample lines are a good starting point. The basic syntax is:

| Name/description (without quotes) | URL |
| --- | --- |
| gmail | https://gmail.com/ |

**Separate the two fields with a comma.** Remember to save the file! Ensure you retain its UTF-8 encoding - spreadsheet programs may switch to UTF-8-BOM.

## Reuse

You can of course also copy the contents of this package and create multiple form lists with other text. üëç If you do so, you will need to edit the global variable for the location of the csv file.

Requires Python, but if present should work in all operating systems.
