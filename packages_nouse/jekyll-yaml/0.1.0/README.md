This package lets you add some yaml-metadata to a jekyll post.

Typing `:newpost` yields the following:

```
---
date: 2024-12-05
author: YourName
tags:
category:
title:
---
```

Date is set to the current date and authorname can obviously be adjusted.

Change the value `YourName` in line 5 of this package's `package.yml`.

Please make sure to add tags like the following and remain consistent:

```
author: 
tags:
	- tag1
	- tag2
category:
```
