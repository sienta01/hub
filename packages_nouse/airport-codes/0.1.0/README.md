# Espanso Airport Codes 

This is a collection of airport code abbreviations that expand into the city names where they reside. 

This is a port of the same expansion set found in TextExpander. 

If any names or codes are incorrect or missing, please [submit an issue here](https://github.com/gflujan/espanso-airport-codes/issues) or a PR would be even better. ðŸ˜‰ 

Happy espanso'ing!
